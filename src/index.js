        Notice the use of the word "comes up with". 
        This is because the concept of functional programming was not new. 
        It was just not called that. It was called "mathematics".
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Lambda calculus is build around the concept of lambdas (or anonymous functions).

      <Notes>
      In an imperative programming language, a program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do and how to do it. These instructions typically involve changing the state of variables or data structures, and the order in which they are executed is important. Imperative programming languages often use control structures like loops and conditionals to control the flow of execution. Examples: Java, Python & many others.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      In contrast, a functional programming language emphasizes the use of functions to solve problems. Programs in functional programming languages are composed of functions that take inputs and produce outputs without changing the state of variables or data structures. Functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values, and stored in variables. Functional programming languages also avoid side effects, which are changes to the state of variables or data structures that are not part of the function's output. Examples: LISP and its dialects (Scheme, Clojure), Haskell, OCaml and many more.

      The idea of adding a scripting language to web pages is attributed to Brendan Eich, who created the first version of JavaScript while working at Netscape Communications Corporation in 1995. At that time, web pages were mostly static and could only display text and images, but JavaScript enabled web developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. Since then, JavaScript has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world and has played a key role in the development of web applications and the modern web.

        At the same time Facebook releases its own UI framework. 
        <br />
        <br />
        It's called React and it offers a different approach to UI development
        <br />
        <br />
        From developer perspective they wanted to stop thinking in terms of imperative DOM mutations, but rather think about UI as a function of state
        <br />
        <br />
        If you look closely at the slide you notice that Pete Hunt talks about "referentially transparent" functions. Those are pure functions that were descirbed by Church and used in FP.
        <br />
        <br />
        Problem applying this approach directly was that DOM is slow and expensive to manipulate
        <br />
        <br />
        So the Virtual DOM was introduced. It calculated minimal number of changes required and translated them into imperatibve DOM operations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Developer focuses on the data correctness and is free from the DOM manipulation
        <br />
        <br />
        React had no assumptions about how you manage apps state so it was common to use frameworks like Backbone (not for Facebook)
        <br />
        <br />
        But as you may remember MVC pattern never worked for Facebook. So how did the ended up solving the state management problem?

        Unidirecrtion data flow was somewhat a novelty at that time
        <br />
        <br />
        the biggest difference between Flux and MVC is that Flux avoids cascading effects by preventing nested updates
        <br />
        <br />
        Flux guarantees future developers can trace where an action starts and its downstream effects.
        <br />
        <br />
        Actions describe what happened
        <br />
        <br />
        dispatcher is a central place where all the actions are processed
        <br />
        <br />
        Slide is inaccurate FLUX had many stores
        <br />
        <br />
        Store UI as react wants
        <br />
        <br />
        Flux was pattern and not a library so at that point communuty picked up and come up with dozens of Flux implementation

        Ideas from Functional Programming, Dan admits that: pure functions, immutability
        <br />
        <br />
        Changes are made with pure functions: Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action and return a new state.
        <br />
        <br />
        Redux become standart for state management in React for a while.
        <br />
        <br />
        Boilerplate was an issue
        <br />
        <br /> 
        Developers need to define actions, action creators, and reducers for every state change, which can lead to a lot of repetitive code and make the codebase harder to maintain.

        Redux was used by web version of Twitter
        <br />
        <br />
        Redux used context api since it was undocumented beta feature of React 
        <br />
        <br />
        Now it is available to everyone, it is more flexible but more chaotic
        <br />
        <br />
        TypeScript adds even more overhead
        <br />
        <br />
        Era of extremely large web apps is over with web 2.0
        <br />
        <br />
        web 3.0 not mature enough to build facebook scale apps
        <br />
        <br />
        vendors have it's own agenda and they push their own solutions

        pure functions do not allow side effects
        <br />
        <br />
        immutable data structures not as flexible on first glance: but they have a lot to offer 
        <br />
        <br />
        unidirectional data flow is unobvious solution for state management
        <br />
        <br />
        How to build your apps? Well it depends on your data and the changes it encounters
        <br />
        <br />
        If you need inspiration, there's a Functional Programming for that
